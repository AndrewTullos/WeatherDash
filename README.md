# WeatherDash

## Description

The "Weather Finder" is a user-friendly web application designed to provide current and five-day weather forecasts for cities around the globe.

## Objective

- **Why was this project built?**  
   To assist users in planning their days by providing real-time and forecasted weather conditions.

- **What problem does it solve?**  
   To provide a visually intuitive way of weather forecasting. It provides users with a clear and concise view of the weather for their chosen city, making it easier for them to plan activities accordingly.

- **What did you learn?**  
   To exercise working with third party API's. Throughout the creation of this project, I've become more proficient in working with APIs, especially the OpenWeatherMap API, and dynamically updating the DOM using vanilla JavaScript.
